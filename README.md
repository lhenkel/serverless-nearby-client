This is a rewrite of something I did at work.  It shows nearby customers
and allows the user to send them a coupon.  This version just shows 
nearby starbucks and faked customer data.  It will send to queue, but
it'll be ignored/deleted in the dev version.

You can see it running here: https://neaby-dev.netlify.app/

The backend API uses Serverless/AWS.  The source code is here: https://github.com/lhenkel/serverless-nearby-api
